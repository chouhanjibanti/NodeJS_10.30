what is nodejs :-

open source , cross platform run time js environment 
allow run js outside the browser
chrome v8 engine (fast engine)

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which compiles JavaScript code into machine code, making it fast and efficient. Node.js is primarily used for server-side programming, enabling developers to use JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development.


Key Features of nodejs :-

1. Asychronous :- 
 blocking and non blocking I/O model
  1   2   3   4    -> 3   2 4  1

2. single threaded but highly scalable

single threaded  ->  object 
It can manage thousands of request without creating of new thread.


3. vert fast
built on the v8 engine -> javascript code to machine code 

4. cross platform :-

work on windows , linux , mac os

why nodejs is used :-

web server and API 
real time app (like chat app , games)
streaming apps (like netflix )
command line tools



Event Loop:-

heart of nodejs.
nodejs allow async/ non blocking Io operations


why we use event loop
n request -> single thread -> handle 
real time app(chat app , multiplayer games)
fast 


stack :- FILO and LIFO

queue -> FIFO

shorthand :-

Event loop  :- single threaded handle all the request 

single thread :- nodejs uses one thread for executing js code

non blocking :- nodejs doesn't wait for operations to complete 

Async pro:- executing without waiting
